在java中，保证线程安全的措施有3种类型：
**1）阻塞同步**，也称为互斥同步，即利用操作系统提供的互斥量来实现对临界资源的排它性访问。因为重量级锁会使得线程阻塞，因此属于同步策略。
**2）非阻塞同步**，利用硬件支持，例如CAS指令，compare and swap，先尝试对数据进行修改，如果修改成功了就成功了，修改时发现冲突了，则进行冲突处理。cas指令存在ABA问题，java为解决这个问题，对数据提供了版本的概念，AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet就是典型的非阻塞同步实现。它首先不停地尝试将变量值+1，如果失败了就不停地尝试，直到成功为止，线程不会阻塞。属于乐观的同步策略。
**3）不需要同步。**这里不需要同步，指的是不需要施加同步措施，例如**final变量**，以及本节描述的**ThreadLocal变量**，都是不需要添加同步措施的。ThreadLocal变量中包含了一个ThreadLocalMap成员，每个线程的线程id，往这个TheadLocal变量存储数据时，线程id作为ThreadLocalMap中的key，每个线程只能访问到与自己相关的数据，不能访问到其他线程存储的数据。

如果对ThreadLocal不熟悉可以看一下下文，ThreadLocalStorage有时会被简称为TLS，此TLS非彼TLS（Transport Layer Security），可结合语境区分。

The **ThreadLocal class** in Java enables you to create variables that can only be read and written by the same thread. Thus, even if two threads are executing the same code, and the code has a reference to aThreadLocal variable, then the two threads cannot see each other's ThreadLocal variables.

**1. Creating a ThreadLocal**
Here is a code example that shows how to create a ThreadLocal variable:

```java
private ThreadLocal myThreadLocal = new ThreadLocal();
```
**As you can see, you instantiate a new ThreadLocal object. This only needs to be done once per thread. Even if different threads execute the same code which accesses a ThreadLocal, each thread will see only its ownThreadLocal instance. Even if two different threads set different values on the same ThreadLocal object, they cannot see each other's values.**

**2. Accessing a ThreadLocal**
Once a ThreadLocal has been created you can set the value to be stored in it like this:
```java
myThreadLocal.set("A thread local value");
```
You read the value stored in a ThreadLocal like this:
```java
String threadLocalValue = (String) myThreadLocal.get();
```
The get() method returns an Object and the set() method takes an Object as parameter.

**3 Generic ThreadLocal**
You can create a generic ThreadLocal so that you do not have to typecast the value returned by get(). Here is a generic ThreadLocal example:

```java
private ThreadLocal myThreadLocal = new ThreadLocal<String>();
```
Now you can only store strings in the ThreadLocal instance. Additionally, you do not need to typecast the value obtained from the ThreadLocal:
```java
myThreadLocal.set("Hello ThreadLocal");
String threadLocalValue = myThreadLocal.get();
```

**4 Initial ThreadLocal Value**
Since values set on a ThreadLocal object only are visible to the thread who set the value, no thread can set an initial value on a ThreadLocal using set() which is visible to all threads.
Instead you can specify an initial value for a ThreadLocal object by subclassing ThreadLocal and overriding the initialValue() method. Here is how that looks:

```java
private ThreadLocal myThreadLocal = new ThreadLocal<String>() {
	@Override
    protected String initialValue() {
		return "This is the initial value";
	}
};
```

Now all threads will see the same initial value when calling get() before having called set() .

**5 Full ThreadLocal Example**
Here is a fully runnable Java ThreadLocal example:

```java
public class ThreadLocalExample {


   public static class MyRunnable implements Runnable {

       private ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<Integer>();

       @Override
       public void run() {
           threadLocal.set( (int) (Math.random() * 100D) );
           try {
               Thread.sleep(2000);
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           }
           System.out.println(threadLocal.get());
       }
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       
       MyRunnable sharedRunnableInstance = new MyRunnable();

       Thread thread1 = new Thread(sharedRunnableInstance);
       Thread thread2 = new Thread(sharedRunnableInstance);

       thread1.start();
       thread2.start();

       thread1.join(); //wait for thread 1 to terminate
       thread2.join(); //wait for thread 2 to terminate
   }

}
```

This example creates a single MyRunnable instance which is passed to two different threads. Both threads execute the run() method, and thus sets different values on the ThreadLocal instance. If the access to theset() call had been synchronized, and it had *not* been a ThreadLocal object, the second thread would have overridden the value set by the first thread.
However, since it *is* a ThreadLocal object then the two threads cannot see each other's values. Thus, they set and get different values.

**6 InheritableThreadLocal**
The InheritableThreadLocal class is a subclass of ThreadLocal. Instead of each thread having its own value inside a ThreadLocal, the InheritableThreadLocal **grants access to values to a thread and all child threads created by that thread**.
