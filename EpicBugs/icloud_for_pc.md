iCloud for PC not working for nearly about 5 ~ 6 years, now Apple still not fix it. That's unacceptable, it gives us trouble again and again! Endless trouble!

I searched the Apple community, keyword 'icloud for windows', it show me nearly 2700+ pages, and each page contains 20 issues about this.
So, how does Apple iCloud Drive team treat these customers voice here? Complaining?

Why we think it's a big trouble and make us angry?
1. Apple sell iCloud+ solutions for money, and sync files across different platforms and devices is a key selling point of the iCloud+ solution.
2. Apple's release of this software on the Microsoft Store serves as a strong signal to customers that the company supports this feature, that's their selling point.
3. But Apple doesn't provide the stable service, no SLA (Service Level Agreement), service unavailable is very common, even lost data.
4. The latest version on Microsoft Store not working, customers has reported this for years, thousands of reports.
5. But Apple still doesn't fix the issue:
    - 2024 Apple update their website page to describe how to install iCloud for PC, but they didn't fix it at all;
    - In Apple, no engineers cares about customers experience for years, no monitor system? no testing? no status page? don't care about customers voice?
    - Microsoft Store customers will automatically update their softwares, but this 'iCloud for PC' is an exception, people had to disable automatically update at all.
    - Each time you update this 'iCloud for PC', it just won't work, if you didn't find this, the trouble comes:
        - you put your valuable files in it,
        - but you don't know the files syncing failed,
        - after sometime, you want to access them on other devices, you find none of them (never been uploaded),
        - what's worse, you may not find this issue, after a long time, you want access some files by keywords, you won't see them,
        - what's the worst, you may find your iCloud for PC not working anymore, so you try sign out/sign in, or disable/enable iCloud for PC, 
          it will prompt you to 'Delete data from your current PC', and you click "OK" (you think all files synced successfully), 
          then, all your data lost including the ones you think they're valuable but not uploaded.
    - Even though you disable automatically update on Microsoft Store, 'iCloud for PC' works abnormally sometimes.
      As mentioned above, if you try sign out/sign in, disable/enable again, you may lose your data.
6. When we find this issue, we report this issue to Apple again and again. But Just as a stone sinks into the ocean, this issue remains unresolved with no Apple engineers stepping in to address it.
7. And Apple censorship workers even delete my post: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/256001774.
8. If Apple still don't fix this issue, I will report this to Consumers Association, and I will write some blogs, publish some videos to criticize this kind of shit service.
9. And I must, I have to spend some time to migrate all my data to other cloud drive solutions, and cancel all iCloud+ subscriptions.

Apple fail customers' trust. We wait this bugfix for nearly 5 ~ 6 years.

I've encountered all the issues mentioned earlier. That's terrible experience.

>ps: I know iCloudDrive works very well on Apple devices. But it works poorly on Windows devices. Nowadays, people have multiple platform devices are very common. Apple should fix it.
